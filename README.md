# Stanford Law School History Project

## Overview
For 100 years, from 1899 to 1998, Stanford Law School published annual bulletins containing key information about the upcoming academic year. These bulletins are rich with background on faculty, staff, and students; lists of course offerings (often with descriptions and assigned textbooks); and other administrative miscellanea (e.g. annual tuition, admissions requirements). These bulletins paint a picture of one law school as it changed over the years; but they also paint a picture of the changing nature of legal education—and the changing character of those who decided to study law over the years, both as students and academics.

In 2009, Professor Hank Greely found a trove of bulletins and set about digitizing them. Research Assistants Sarah Wilson (2013) and James Rathmell (2016, 2019) investigated the contents of the bulletins and began extracting data in an analyzable format.

This readme summarizes the objectives of the project to date, the contents of the associated repository, and the progress that Wilson and Rathmell made on the project through 2019. It then proposes future areas for research.

## Project Scope

## Project Repository

The project repository contains the following files.

* **Bulletins.** PDFs of all bulletins 1899-1998. 111 files.
  * **Students** Pages from each bulletin that lists information about students. Files are named according to the bulletin they came from, rather than which class is listed. Most bulletins list the students’ prior degrees and geographic origin, and most also provide summary statistics, e.g. undergraduate/graduate law students or number of students matriculating from different undergraduate universities. Note: The first bulletin to list students was for academic year 1901-1902. From 1901 to 1965 and from 1972 to 1984 (except 1981-1982), the bulletins list the prior year’s students. From 1965 to 1972 and for 1981-1982, the bulletins list the current year’s students. From 1985 to 1998, only summary statistics are provided.
* **Project.** Deliverables on the project to date. See “Progress to Date” section for details on these files.
  * **Documents.** High-level summaries of information contained in bulletins. Compiled by Sarah Wilson.
