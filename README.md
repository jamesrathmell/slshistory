# Stanford Law School History Project

## Overview
From 1899 to 1998, Stanford Law School (SLS) published bulletins, which contained key information for students about the upcoming academic year. The bulletins are rich with information. Unfortunately, it is also very time intensive to extract data from them. Research Assistants Sarah Wilson (2013) and James Rathmell (2016, 2019) began investigating the contents of the bulletins and extracting data in an analyzable format for research use.

This readme summarizes the objectives of the project to date; the contents of the associated repository; and the progress that Wilson and Rathmell made on the project through 2019. It then

## Project Scope

## Project Repository

The project repository contains the following files.

* **Bulletins.** PDFs of all bulletins 1899-1998. 111 files.
  * **Students** Pages from each bulletin that lists prior year’s class of students. Note that these are named according to the bulletin from which they came (so 1930-1931 provides a list of students from the 1929-1930 academic year). Some bulletins provide summary statistics, e.g. undergraduate/graduate law students, number of students matriculating from different undergraduate universities.
* **Project.** Deliverables on the project to date. See “Progress to Date” section for details on these files.
  * **Documents.** High-level summaries of information contained in bulletins. Compiled by Sarah Wilson.
