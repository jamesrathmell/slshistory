# Courses

The two datasets contained here provide the full listing of courses taught at the Law School from 1899-1998, as recorded in the bulletins. They are presented in two ways: on the aggregate, with each course listed as a separate entry; and individually, with each session (where a session is a course taught in a particular year or quarter) presented as a separate entry. Note that there may be multiple sessions of the same course in a given bulletin.

You can explore the timeline of courses at [the site for this project](https://slshistory.weebly.com/courses.html).

One promising area for future research would be to explore how the curriculum changed over time, both in terms of the required first-year curriculum, and in terms of how new subjects were introduced (e.g. environmental law, critical legal theory) while old ones were retired (e.g. mines and irrigation, pleadings).

## Notes

* While all of the course sessions are listed, the dataset is incomplete as to first-year offerings, terms, and course descriptions.

* In some cases, courses were listed in the bulletin for a given year, but were marked as not being offered. These are not included in the dataset.

* Where multiple instructors taught one session of the course, they are listed together. Where instructors taught different sections, they are listed separately.
