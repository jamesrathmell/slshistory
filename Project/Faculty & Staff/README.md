# Faculty & Staff
The two datasets contained here provide information on faculty and staff who were employed at the Law School from 1899 to 1998. They are presented in two ways: on the aggregate, with each faculty member listed as a separate entry; and by title, with each tenure listed as a separate entry (e.g. "Visting Professor of Law" and "Professor of Law" are two separate entries for the same faculty member).

This repository also contains packaged Tableau workbooks for the two timelines on the project site.

You can explore the timeline and gallery of faculty and staff at [the site for this project](https://slshistory.weebly.com/faculty--staff.html).

## Notes

* 26 individuals were specified as the instructors of specific courses in the course listings, but do not appear in the faculty listings for that year. These are in the dataset, but their tenure is "no record" and they do not have titles. They often appear just by their last names (e.g. "Tversky").
