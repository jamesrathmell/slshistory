# Student Pages
This folder contains just the pages listing students from each bulletin. Files are named according to the bulletin they came from, rather than which class is listed. Most bulletins list the students’ prior degrees and geographic origin, and most also provide summary statistics, e.g. undergraduate/graduate law students or number of students matriculating from different undergraduate universities.

A promising area for investigation would be to look at how the geographic and academic origins of Stanford Law students have changed over time. This would require extracting the data into a machine-readable format, then visualizing the data on a [map](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/maps_build.htm), [flow map](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/flow_map.html), or [stream graph](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/stream_graph.html) (see also [R resources for stream graphs](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/streamgraph/).

Notes:
* The first bulletin to list students was for academic year 1901-1902.
* From 1901 to 1965 and from 1972 to 1984 (except 1981-1982), the bulletins list the prior year’s students.
* From 1965 to 1972 and for 1981-1982, the bulletins list the current year’s students.
* From 1985 to 1998, only summary statistics are provided.
