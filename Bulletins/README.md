# Bulletins
This folder contains the 111 bulletins for academic years from 1899 to 1998, including summer sessions. The pages that list students can be found in the "Students" subfolder.

Data from the bulletins on faculty/staff and courses can be found in the [Project](https://github.com/jamesrathmell/slshistory/tree/master/Project) folder of this repository. Promising areas for future data extraction and visualization are:

* How have the geographic and academic origins of Stanford Law students changed over time? (See [Students](/Students) folder for more information.)
* How have scholarships and tuition changed over time?
* How have admissions requirements changed over time?
