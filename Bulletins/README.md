# Bulletins
This folder contains the 111 bulletins for academic years from 1899 to 1998, including summer sessions. The pages that list students can be found in the "Students" subfolder.

## Notes

**November 17, 2009 (Sarah Wilson)**
* Missing (as of November 17, 2009) these two years: 1904-1905 and 1905-1906.
* Note that the page numbering is wacky for 1906-1907; not sure why…

**Update December 24, 2016 (James Rathmell)**
* In 1985-1987, the bulletins stop listing administrators
* In 1985-1987, the bulletin does not list library staff
* 1989-1990 is the only single year bulletin after 1985-1986  

## Data
Data from the bulletins on faculty/staff and courses can be found in the [Project](https://github.com/jamesrathmell/slshistory/tree/master/Project) folder of this repository.

Promising areas for future data extraction and visualization are:

* How did the geographic and academic origins of Stanford Law students change over time? (See [Students](https://github.com/jamesrathmell/slshistory/tree/master/Bulletins/Students) folder for more information.)
* How did scholarships and tuition change over time?
* How did admissions requirements change over time?
* How did the curriculum change over time?
* How did first-year requirements changed over time?
